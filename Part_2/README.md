- 'Date': This is the column containing information about the date the weather was recorded.
- 'Chance of precipitation': This column contains information about the probability of rain (or probability of precipitation) in percent. It represents the predicted odds of rain for that day.
- 'Temperature': This column contains temperature information in Celsius (°C). It represents how hot or cold the air is for that day.
- 'Feels like temperature °C': This column contains information about the perceived temperature in Celsius (°C). It represents the temperature perceived by humans based on factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind.
- 'Wind gust mph': This column contains information about gust strength (highest wind speed) in mph (miles per hour).
- 'Visibility': This is a column that contains visibility information in units of measurement such as kilometers (km) or miles (miles). It denotes how clear the air is for that day.
- 'Humidity': This column contains information about humidity in percent (%). It represents the amount of water vapor present in the air.
- 'UV': This is the column containing information about the ultraviolet (UV) index. It represents the level of ultraviolet rays from the sun that day.
- 'Wind direction': This is the column containing information about the wind direction. It denotes the direction in which the wind is blowing, for example north, south, east, west, etc.
- 'Speed': This is a column containing wind speed information in units of measurement such as km/h (kilometers per hour) or mph (miles per hour). It represents the strength and weakness of the wind that day.

***At first I made the assumption that this was a Time Series Forecasting problem. However, after doing the analysis steps, I think it would be better to do a classification problem***
