# Data_Project
# This is a personal project about data
#### This project will use languages specializing in data processing such as Python and R
The skills used in this project will include the basic skills of a **Data Engineer, Data Analyst, Data Science**
#### Project consists of 3 parts
+ Collect data
+ Data analysis
+ Research and build model

##### Data: Weather data, taken in real time on a website specializing in weather
More details will be covered in **part 1**.

- Data after being downloaded and through a few simple processing steps will be uploaded to Data Warehouse.
Then the data will be taken from the data warehouse for ready to analysis and processing by R

- Next, we will do some simple analysis with this data

- Finally, we will build two models, one using traditional machine learning, the other using a simple neural network for prediction. Finally will compare, and answer the question:
  
**Whether with a simple data, the predictive ability of traditional Machine learning algorithms or Deep Learning will be superior?**
